# Subgroup Discovery in Sequential Data

The `Main.ipynb` contains all the necessary code to execute the pre processing and subgroup discovery steps.

As also stated in the notebook, the dataset is from [GeoLife](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/geolife-gps-trajectory-dataset-user-guide/), and the pre processed files can be found in this [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u4K665fdOLnWCNtdY1R7J96BcZRan29E)
